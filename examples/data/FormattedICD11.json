There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication.",

In children and adolescents, separation anxiety typically focuses on caregivers, parents or other family members and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally normative. In adults, the focus is typically a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of separation anxiety may include thoughts of harm or untoward events befalling the attachment figure, reluctance to go to school or work, recurrent excessive distress upon separation, reluctance or refusal to sleep away from the attachment figure, and recurrent nightmares about separation. The symptoms persist for at least several months and are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.",

Low body weight is accompanied by a persistent pattern of behaviours to prevent restoration of normal weight, which may include behaviours aimed at reducing energy intake (restricted eating), purging behaviours (e.g. self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives), and behaviours aimed at increasing energy expenditure (e.g. excessive exercise), typically associated with a fear of weight gain.

A depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthless or excessive or inappropriate guilt, feelings or hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, and suicidality. There is no history of manic or mixed episodes.",

There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a central nervous system depressant. In addition to ability to produce Alcohol Intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing properties, resulting in Alcohol Dependence in some people and Alcohol Withdrawal when alcohol use is reduced or discontinued.

Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body (e.g., cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from behaviour during Alcohol Intoxication is well recognized and is included in the definitions of harmful use of alcohol (i.e., Episode of Harmful Use of Alcohol and Harmful Pattern of Use of Alcohol).

Disturbances affect multiple areas of personality functioning (e.g., identity or sense of self, ability to form intimate relationships, ability to control impulses and modulate behaviour). However, some areas of personality functioning may be relatively less affected. There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships and the performance of most expected social and occupational roles is compromised to some degree. Relationships are likely to be characterised by conflict, avoidance, withdrawal, or extreme dependency (e.g., few friendships maintained, persistent conflict in work relationships and consequent occupational problems, romantic relationships characterised by serious disruption or inappropriate submissiveness). Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate severity. Moderate Personality Disorder is sometimes associated with harm to self or others, and is associated with marked impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, although functioning in circumscribed areas may be maintained.",

An exception is sleep-related eating disorder, which has been observed to arise during all stages of non-REM sleep. This group of disorders is also characterised by partial or complete amnesia for the event, inappropriate or absent responsiveness to efforts by others to intervene or redirect the person during the episode, and limited (e.g., a single visual scene) or no associated cognition or dream imagery. The experiences or behaviours are sufficiently severe to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning or significant risk of injury to the individual or to others (e.g., thrashing or striking out in response to efforts to restrain the individual).",

The symptoms do not occur exclusively during hypnogogic or hypnopompic states, are not better accounted for by another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., Schizophrenia), and are not due to another disorder or disease classified elsewhere (e.g., epilepsies with visual symptoms).",

A mixed episode is characterised by the presence of several prominent manic and several prominent depressive symptoms consistent with those observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes, which either occur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day). Symptoms must include an altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressive episode (i.e., depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present most of the day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by a treatment intervention. If the individual has experienced Manic or Mixed Episodes in the past, a duration of 2 weeks is not required in order to diagnose a current episode if all other diagnostic requirements are met.",

The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use cannabis, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use cannabis. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of cannabis, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of cannabis, or repeated use of cannabis or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if cannabis use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.",

Onset of symptoms is related to exposure and progression can be rapid especially with acute exposure. In many cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases. Investigations such as brain imaging or neurophysiological testing may be abnormal. Lead poisoning is associated with abnormalities on brain imaging including widespread calcification and increased signal on MRI T2-weighted images of periventricular white matter, basal ganglia hypothalamus and pons.

Cataplexy is a sudden and uncontrollable loss of muscle tone arising during wakefulness that is typically triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. Although cataplexy is a pathognomonic symptom of type 1 narcolepsy, it may not manifest until years following onset of the sleepiness. In such cases, a diagnosis of narcolepsy, type 1 may be made based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-hypocretin levels < 110 picograms per milliliter. Episodes of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations may also be present. The disorder is not attributable to a disease of the nervous system or other medical condition.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep plus either: a) cataplexy and multiple sleep latency test/polysomnography (MSLT/PSG) findings characteristic of narcolepsy; or b) demonstrated CSF hypocretin deficiency.",

It is characterised by persistent and frequent or pervasive disruption of the rhythmic flow of speech (stutter-typical symptoms, core symptoms) and by frequently occurring accompanying symptoms such as speech-related anxieties and by avoidance of speech situations. It significantly affects communication. Stutter-typical symptoms are repetitions of sounds, syllables or monosyllabic words, prolongations, word breaks, audible or silent blockage of speech production, insertions of sounds and syllables, or excessive use of interjections. Accompanying symptoms are strategies to control, escape or avoid disfluencies, for example by muscle tension, breath irregularities, co-movements of mimic muscles, head, or limbs.",

This type of cluttering is usually labelled just \"cluttering\". It is characterised by persistent and frequent or pervasive disruption of the rhythmic flow of speech (clutter-typical symptoms) that is untypical for stuttering. It impairs communication and intelligibility. Clutter-typical symptoms are a higher than normal or irregular speech tempo, or both, violations of word and sentence structures with phonological abnormalities, confluence or omission of syllables, unusual pauses, abnormal syllable accent or unusual speech rhythm, and difficulties to maintain normal patterns of sounds, syllables, phrases, or pauses.",

Core signs of pellagra include dermatological changes (sensitivity to sunlight, lesions, alopecia, and oedema) and diarrhoea. With prolonged nutritional deficiency cognitive symptoms that include aggressivity, motor disturbances (ataxia and restlessness), confusion, and weakness are observed. Treatment with nutritional supplementation (e.g., niacin) typically results in reversal of symptoms.",

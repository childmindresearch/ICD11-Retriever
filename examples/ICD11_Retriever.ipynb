      "Neurodevelopmental disorders \n",
      " Neurodevelopmental disorders are behavioural and cognitive disorders that arise during the developmental period that involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions. Although behavioural and cognitive deficits are present in many mental and behavioural disorders that can arise during the developmental period (e.g., Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder), only disorders whose core features are neurodevelopmental are included in this grouping. The presumptive etiology for neurodevelopmental disorders is complex, and in many individual cases is unknown. \n",
      "\n",
      "Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders \n",
      " Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders are characterised by significant impairments in reality testing and alterations in behaviour manifest in positive symptoms such as persistent delusions, persistent hallucinations, disorganised thinking (typically manifest as disorganised speech), grossly disorganised behaviour, and experiences of passivity and control, negative symptoms such as blunted or flat affect and avolition, and psychomotor disturbances. The symptoms occur with sufficient frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural norms. These symptoms do not arise as a feature of another mental and behavioural disorder (e.g., a mood disorder, delirium, or a disorder due to substance use). The categories in this grouping should not be used to classify the expression of ideas, beliefs, or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Catatonia \n",
      " Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances, characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. The assessment of catatonia is complex and requires observation, interview and physical exam. Catatonia can occur in the context of another mental disorder, such as Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorders, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders, especially Autism Spectrum Disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal from certain psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of certain psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Finally, Catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders. Examples of medical conditions that may be associated with Catatonia include diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and encephalitis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mood disorders \n",
      " Mood Disorders refers to a superordinate grouping of Bipolar and Depressive Disorders. Mood disorders are defined according to particular types of mood episodes and their pattern over time. The primary types of mood episodes are Depressive episode, Manic episode, Mixed episode, and Hypomanic episode. Mood episodes are not independently diagnosable entities, and therefore do not have their own diagnostic codes. Rather, mood episodes make up the primary components of most of the Depressive and Bipolar Disorders. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety or fear-related disorders \n",
      " Anxiety and fear-related disorders are characterised by excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioural disturbances, with symptoms that are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Fear and anxiety are closely related phenomena; fear represents a reaction to perceived imminent threat in the present, whereas anxiety is more future-oriented, referring to perceived anticipated threat. A key differentiating feature among the Anxiety and fear-related disorders are disorder-specific foci of apprehension, that is, the stimulus or situation that triggers the fear or anxiety. The clinical presentation of Anxiety and fear-related disorders typically includes specific associated cognitions that can assist in differentiating among the disorders by clarifying the focus of apprehension. \n",
      "\n",
      "Obsessive-compulsive or related disorders \n",
      " Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders is a group of disorders characterised by repetitive thoughts and behaviours that are believed to share similarities in aetiology and key diagnostic validators. Cognitive phenomena such as obsessions, intrusive thoughts and preoccupations are central to a subset of these conditions (i.e., obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hypochondriasis, and olfactory reference disorder) and are accompanied by related repetitive behaviours. Hoarding Disorder is not associated with intrusive unwanted thoughts but rather is characterised by a compulsive need to accumulate possessions and distress related to discarding them. Also included in the grouping are body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders, which are primarily characterised by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g., hair-pulling, skin-picking) and lack a prominent cognitive aspect. The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disorders specifically associated with stress \n",
      " Disorders specifically associated with stress are directly related to exposure to a stressful or traumatic event, or a series of such events or adverse experiences. For each of the disorders in this grouping, an identifiable stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. Although not all individuals exposed to an identified stressor will develop a disorder, the disorders in this grouping would not have occurred without experiencing the stressor. Stressful events for some disorders in this grouping are within the normal range of life experiences (e.g., divorce, socio-economic problems, bereavement). Other disorders require the experience of a stressor of an extremely threatening or horrific nature (i.e., potentially traumatic events). With all disorders in this grouping, it is the nature, pattern, and duration of the symptoms that arise in response to the stressful events—together with associated functional impairment—that distinguishes the disorders. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dissociative disorders \n",
      " Dissociative disorders are characterised by involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal integration of one or more of the following: identity, sensations, perceptions, affects, thoughts, memories, control over bodily movements, or behaviour. Disruption or discontinuity may be complete, but is more commonly partial, and can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. The symptoms of dissociative disorders are not due to the direct effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects, are not better explained by another Mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder, a Sleep-wake disorder, a Disease of the nervous system or other health condition, and are not part of an accepted cultural, religious, or spiritual practice. Dissociative symptoms in dissociative disorders are sufficiently severe to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Feeding or eating disorders \n",
      " Feeding and Eating Disorders involve abnormal eating or feeding behaviours that are not explained by another health condition and are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned. Feeding disorders involve behavioural disturbances that are not related to body weight and shape concerns, such as eating of non-edible substances or voluntary regurgitation of foods. Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elimination disorders \n",
      " Elimination disorders include the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed (enuresis) and the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places (encopresis). Elimination disorders should only be diagnosed after the individual has reached a developmental age when continence is ordinarily expected (5 years for enuresis and 4 years for encopresis). The urinary or faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e., an atypical extension of normal infantile incontinence), or may have arisen following a period of acquired bladder or bowel control. An Elimination disorder should not be diagnosed if the behaviour is fully attributable to another health condition that causes incontinence, congenital or acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract or bowel, or excessive use of laxatives or diuretics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience \n",
      " Disorders of bodily distress and bodily experience are characterised by disturbances in the person’s experience of his or her body. Bodily distress disorder involves bodily symptoms that the individual finds distressing and to which excessive attention is directed. Body integrity dysphoria involves a disturbance in the person’s experience of the body manifested by the persistent desire to have a specific physical disability accompanied by persistent discomfort, or intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours \n",
      " Disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours are mental and behavioural disorders that develop as a result of the use of predominantly psychoactive substances, including medications, or specific repetitive rewarding and reinforcing behaviours. \n",
      "\n",
      "Impulse control disorders \n",
      " Impulse control disorders are characterised by the repeated failure to resist an impulse, drive, or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person, at least in the short-term, despite consequences such as longer-term harm either to the individual or to others, marked distress about the behaviour pattern, or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Impulse Control Disorders involve a range of specific behaviours, including fire-setting, stealing, sexual behaviour, and explosive outbursts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disruptive behaviour or dissocial disorders \n",
      " Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are characterised by persistent behaviour problems that range from markedly and persistently defiant, disobedient, provocative or spiteful (i.e., disruptive) behaviours to those that persistently violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws (i.e., dissocial). Onset of Disruptive and dissocial disorders is commonly, though not always, during childhood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Personality disorders and related traits \n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Paraphilic disorders \n",
      " Paraphilic disorders are characterised by persistent and intense patterns of atypical sexual arousal, manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, or behaviours, the focus of which involves others whose age or status renders them unwilling or unable to consent and on which the person has acted or by which he or she is markedly distressed. Paraphilic disorders may include arousal patterns involving solitary behaviours or consenting individuals only when these are associated with marked distress that is not simply a result of rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by others or with significant risk of injury or death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Factitious disorders \n",
      " Factitious disorders are characterised by intentionally feigning, falsifying, inducing, or aggravating medical, psychological, or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury in oneself or in another person, most commonly a child dependent, associated with identified deception. A pre-existing disorder or disease may be present, but the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or induces additional symptoms. Individuals with factitious disorder seek treatment or otherwise present themselves or another person as ill, injured, or impaired based on the feigned, falsified, or self-induced signs, symptoms, or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious external rewards or incentives (e.g., obtaining disability payments or evading criminal prosecution). This is in contrast to Malingering, in which obvious external rewards or incentives motivate the behaviour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Neurocognitive disorders \n",
      " Neurocognitive disorders are characterised by primary clinical deficits in cognitive functioning that are acquired rather than developmental. That is, neurocognitive disorders do not include disorders characterised by deficits in cognitive function that are present from birth or that typically arise during the developmental period, which are classified in the grouping neurodevelopmental disorders. Rather, neurocognitive disorders represent a decline from a previously attained level of functioning. Although cognitive deficits are present in many mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorders), only disorders whose core features are cognitive are included in the neurocognitive disorders grouping. In cases where the underlying pathology and aetiology for neurocognitive disorders can be determined, the identified etiology should be classified separately. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mental or behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium \n",
      " Syndromes associated with pregnancy or the puerperium (commencing within about 6 weeks after delivery) that involve significant mental and behavioural features. If the symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder, that diagnosis should also be assigned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere \n",
      " Psychological and behavioural factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere are those that may adversely affect the manifestation, treatment, or course of a condition classified in another chapter of the ICD. These factors may adversely affect the manifestation, treatment, or course of the disorder or disease classified in another chapter by: interfering with the treatment of the disorder or disease by affecting treatment adherence or care seeking; constituting an additional health risk; or influencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or otherwise necessitate medical attention. This diagnosis should be assigned only when the factors increase the risk of suffering, disability, or death and represent a focus of clinical attention, and should be assigned together with the diagnosis for the relevant other condition. \n",

      "Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere \n",
      " This grouping includes syndromes characterised by the presence of prominent psychological or behavioural symptoms judged to be direct pathophysiological consequences of a medical condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not accounted for by delirium or by another mental and behavioural disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition (e.g., adjustment disorder or anxiety symptoms in response to being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness). These categories should be used in addition to the diagnosis for the presumed underlying disorder or disease when the psychological and behavioural symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention. \n",

      "Sleep-wake disorders \n",
      " Sleep-wake disorders are characterised by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep (insomnia disorders), excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence disorders), respiratory disturbance during sleep (sleep-related breathing disorders), disorders of the sleep-wake schedule (circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders), abnormal movements during sleep (sleep-related movement disorders), or problematic behavioural or physiological events that occur while falling asleep, during sleep, or upon arousal from sleep (parasomnia disorders). \n",

      "Sexual dysfunctions \n",
      " Sexual Dysfunctions are syndromes that comprise the various ways in which adult people may have difficulty experiencing personally satisfying, non-coercive sexual activities. Sexual response is a complex interaction of psychological, interpersonal, social, cultural and physiological processes and one or more of these factors may affect any stage of the sexual response. In order to be considered a sexual dysfunction, the dysfunction must: 1) occur frequently, although it may be absent on some occasions; 2) have been present for at least several months; and 3) be associated with clinically significant distress. \n",

      "Disorders of intellectual development \n",
      " Disorders of intellectual development are a group of etiologically diverse conditions originating during the developmental period characterised by significantly below average intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour that are approximately two or more standard deviations below the mean (approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests. Where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development requires greater reliance on clinical judgment based on appropriate assessment of comparable behavioural indicators. \n",
      "\n",
      "Developmental speech or language disorders \n",
      " Developmental speech or language disorders arise during the developmental period and are characterised by difficulties in understanding or producing speech and language or in using language in context for the purposes of communication that are outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. The observed speech and language problems are not attributable to regional, social, or cultural/ethnic language variations and are not fully explained by anatomical or neurological abnormalities. The presumptive aetiology for Developmental speech or language disorders is complex, and in many individual cases, is unknown. \n",
      "\n",
      "Autism spectrum disorder \n",
      " Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and sociocultural context. The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are sufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the individual’s functioning observable in all settings, although they may vary according to social, educational, or other context. Individuals along the spectrum exhibit a full range of intellectual functioning and language abilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "Developmental learning disorder \n",
      " Developmental learning disorder is characterised by significant and persistent difficulties in learning academic skills, which may include reading, writing, or arithmetic. The individual’s performance in the affected academic skill(s) is markedly below what would be expected for chronological age and general level of intellectual functioning, and results in significant impairment in the individual’s academic or occupational functioning. Developmental learning disorder first manifests when academic skills are taught during the early school years. Developmental learning disorder is not due to a disorder of intellectual development, sensory impairment (vision or hearing), neurological or motor disorder, lack of availability of education, lack of proficiency in the language of academic instruction, or psychosocial adversity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Developmental motor coordination disorder \n",
      " Developmental motor coordination disorder is characterised by a significant delay in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills and impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness, or inaccuracy of motor performance. Coordinated motor skills are markedly below that expected given the individual's chronological age and level of intellectual functioning. Onset of coordinated motor skills difficulties occurs during the developmental period and is typically apparent from early childhood. Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in functioning (e.g. in activities of daily living, school work, and vocational and leisure activities). Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not solely attributable to a Disease of the Nervous System, Disease of the Musculoskeletal System or Connective Tissue, sensory impairment, and not better explained by a Disorder of Intellectual Development. \n",
      "\n",
      "Primary tics or tic disorders \n",
      " Primary tics or tic disorders are characterised by the presence of chronic motor and/or vocal (phonic) tics. Motor and vocal tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic, and recurrent movements or vocalizations, respectively. In order to be diagnosed, tics must have been present for at least one year, although they may not manifest consistently. \n",
      "\n",
      "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \n",
      " Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern (at least 6 months) of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning. There is evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, typically by early to mid-childhood, though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later. The degree of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity is outside the limits of normal variation expected for age and level of intellectual functioning. Inattention refers to significant difficulty in sustaining attention to tasks that do not provide a high level of stimulation or frequent rewards, distractibility and problems with organisation. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity and difficulties with remaining still, most evident in structured situations that require behavioural self-control. Impulsivity is a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli, without deliberation or consideration of the risks and consequences. The relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics varies across individuals and may change over the course of development. In order for a diagnosis to be made, manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple situations or settings (e.g., home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary according to the structure and demands of the setting. Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural, or neurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stereotyped movement disorder \n",
      " Stereotyped movement disorder is characterised by the persistent (e.g., lasting several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period, are not caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal), and markedly interfere with normal activities or result in self-inflicted bodily injury. Stereotyped movements that are non-injurious can include body rocking, head rocking, finger-flicking mannerisms, and hand flapping. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviours can include repetitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and biting of the hands, lips, or other body parts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Neurodevelopmental syndrome due to prenatal alcohol exposure \n",
      " A syndrome that involves significant neurodevelopmental features that are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention but that do not fulfill the diagnostic requirements of any of the specific Neurodevelopmental disorders and is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure, based on evidence from the history and physical examination. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome \n",
      " A syndrome that involves significant neurodevelopmental features that do not fulfill the diagnostic requirements of any of the specific neurodevelopmental disorders that is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a health condition not classified under mental and behavioural disorders (e.g., autistic-like features in Rett syndrome; aggression and self-mutilation in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, abnormalities in language development in Williams syndrome), based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings.\n",

The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from smoking naturally cultivated cannabis in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior). Synthetic Cannabinoid Intoxication may therefore present more frequently with psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis.

These events often result in reductions in blood oxygen saturation and are usually terminated by brief arousals from sleep. Excessive sleepiness is a major presenting complaint in many but not all cases. Reports of insomnia, poor sleep quality, and fatigue are also common. Upper airway resistance syndrome shares the same pathophysiology and should be classified here. In adults (> 18 years), obstructive sleep apnoea is diagnosed when the frequency of obstructive events (apnoeas, hypopneas or respiratory event-related arousals) is greater than 15 per hour. The disorder may also be diagnosed when the frequency is greater than five per hour and: a) symptoms attributable to the disorder (e.g., sleepiness or sleep disruption) are present; or b) nocturnal respiratory distress or observed apnoea/habitual snoring are reported; or c) when hypertension, a mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus are present. In children, the disorder is diagnosed when the frequency of obstructive events is greater than one per hour, accompanied by signs or symptoms related to the breathing disorder.\n\nNote: A definitive diagnosis requires objective evidence based on polysomnography."}, "exclusion": [{"label": {"@language": "en", "@value": "Obstructive neonatal apnoea"}, "foundationReference": "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1421696615"}], "level": 2}, "484": {"@context": "http://id.who.int/icd/contexts/contextForFoundationEntity.json", "@id": "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/224267797", "parent": ["http://id.who.int/icd/entity/877557231"], "child": ["http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1514276050", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1750742010", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1928918452", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1024837047", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/230938285", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1890283061", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/843691445", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1272415579", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1778450135", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/253225246", "http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2038949701"], "browserUrl": "https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/foundation/en#224267797", "title": {"@language": "en", "@value": "Sleep-related hypoventilation or hypoxemia disorders"}, "definition": {"@language": "en", "@value": "The primary feature of these disorders is insufficient sleep related ventilation, resulting in abnormally elevated arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) during sleep.

A depressive episode is characterised by a period of depressed mood or diminished interest in activities occurring most of the day, nearly every day during a period lasting at least two weeks accompanied by other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, changes in appetite or sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and reduced energy or fatigue. In a moderate depressive episode, several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a large number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.
